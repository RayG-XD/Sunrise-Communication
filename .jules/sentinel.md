## 2025-05-18 - Avoid Hardcoding Plaintext Superuser Credentials in Administrative Utility Scripts
**Vulnerability:** Superuser credentials (including administrative password) were hardcoded in plain text inside `sunrise-backend/create_admin.py` database initialization script.
**Learning:** Utility/seeding scripts created for local environment setup often inadvertently contain default superuser credentials that get checked into version control, creating a critical vulnerability if executed in staging or production.
**Prevention:** Always source superuser credentials (especially passwords) from environment variables (e.g. `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`), and abort execution cleanly if required secret environment variables are missing.
